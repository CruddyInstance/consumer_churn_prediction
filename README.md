# consumer_churn_prediction
* The dataset was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers 
   columns are pretty self-explanatory in this dataset. 
* I used deep learning to make prediction in this dataset.
* The key part was to use upscaling so that the model does not overfit to dataset.
* The final accuracy is around 92% which is pretty good.
